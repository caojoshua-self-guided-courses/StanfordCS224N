# CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

This repo contains my coding solutions to CS224N. See the [course website](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1244/index.html).

## Setup

I followed the conda environment setup following each assignment PDF. I skipped GPU training for assignment 4.

For Assignment 4, I needed to `python -m pip install` the following modules from the conda environment:

* sacrebleu
* sentencepiece
* tensorboard
